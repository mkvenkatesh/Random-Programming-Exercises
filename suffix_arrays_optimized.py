Suffix Arrays - Optimized O(n log n) - prefix doubling

A suffix is a non-empty substring at the end of the string. A suffix array
contains all the sorted suffixes of a string

A suffix array provides a space efficient alternative to a suffix tree which
itself is a compressed version of a trie. Suffix array can do something a suffix
tree can, with some additional information such as Longest Common Prefix (LCP)
array. 

A suffix array can be constructed from Suffix tree by doing a DFS traversal of
the suffix tree. In fact Suffix array and suffix tree both can be constructed
from each other in linear time.

Advantages of suffix arrays over suffix trees include improved space
requirements, simpler linear time construction algorithms (e.g., compared to
Ukkonenâ€™s algorithm) and improved cache locality

# Algorithm
1. The first step is to generate all the suffix starting with the whole string
   and then looping through and producing the 1 to end, 2 to end etc until the
   end character.
2. We assign current and next rank to the first two characters of the suffixes.
   A simple rank could be str[i]-'a'. If no characters are found, set it to -1
        Index    Suffix            Rank          Next Rank 
        0        banana            1              0
        1        anana             0              13    
        2        nana              13             0
        3        ana               0              13
        4        na                13             0 
        5        a                 0             -1 
3. Sort the array using the current and next rank
		Index    Suffix            Rank          Next Rank 
        5        a                 0               -1
        1        anana             0               13    
        3        ana               0               13
        0        banana            1               0
        2        nana              13              0
        4        na                13              0  
	
4. So far we sorted all the suffixes through first two characters. Now we do the
        next 4, 8 and so on until 2*len(n) times. We loop from 4 to 2N and
        calculate the current and next rank the following way.

        a. Current Rank - Assign 0 as the current rank for the first suffix. For
        remaining suffixes, we take the rank pair from previous iteration i.e
        (current rank, next rank) from the previous time and see if it's the
        same as the rank pair of the previous suffix. If they are the same, set
        current rank to same as previous suffix current rank, else increment by
        1 and set it as current rank for the current suffix.
        
            Index      Suffix          Rank       
            5          a               0     [Assign 0 to first]        
            1          anana           1     (0, 13) is different from previous
            3          ana             1     (0, 13) is same as previous     
            0          banana          2     (1, 0) is different from previous      
            2          nana            3     (13, 0) is different from previous      
            4          na              3     (13, 0) is same as previous  


        b. Next Rank - suppose k is the loop and the initial value is 4, we take
        the subarray from k/2 to end and see what current rank is assigned for
        that suffix (i.e. suffix[k/2:].current_rank) and set that rank. If no
        suffix is found or theres no characters for k/2 to end, set it to -1

            Index      Suffix          Rank        Next Rank
            5          a               0             -1
            1          anana           1              1      
            3          ana             1              0 
            0          banana          2              3
            2          nana            3              3 
            4          na              3              -1       

5. Now sort current and next rank

6. Proceed like this until k <= 2N
